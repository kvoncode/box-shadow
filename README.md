Exploring how to create shadow using CSS

## Initialization

You can create basic project using `create-next-app`. What it do is create project using `Next.js` framework. `Next.js` is using React.js and some opinionated techniques like routing, PWA, SSR, etc.

So I recommend run the command:

```
yarn create next-app
```

You can also use `npm install` or `npx`, but `yarn` is just easier to use.

Documentation for `yarn create` command says: `Creates new projects from any create-* starter kits.`

So it work only with the packages that starts with `create-<package-name>` followed by the `<package-name>`
